# My Sweet Config

*Visualize your dev environment*

Deployed: [sweet-config.herokuapp.com][2] - demo@gmailâ€¢com, hello
<br>
Backend: [sweet-api][7]
<br>
Demo: [youtu.be/Zn94dAHTPyo][8]

## Description

##### Purpose
I built this as an extension to my command line app, [ballin scripts][1], which includes (among other things) a way to automatically backup your developer environment (`.bash_profile`, `brew list`, etc.) to a gist by simply typing `$ gu` in the command line.

##### Pain
GitHub gists are awesome because they are private and store revision history, but they don't provide a good user experience when you want to look at your files within the gist.

##### Solution
[My Sweet Config][2], named after the pride (sweet) we take in our (my) configs, allows you to view your files by category in a clean interface designed specifically for [ballin scripts][1].

## Tech Stack

##### React Frontend
* React.js (user interface library)
  - Built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* React Router
  - Document titles used for navigation history
  - static.json file supports visiting links/routes directly
* Redux (state container)
* Extensive (custom) form validation
* Loading spinners
* Bootstrap/reactstrap
* Dynamic navbar based on user being logged in, highlights the page currently on
* Ability to edit/delete profile with custom alert boxes which require password confirmation

##### Node.js Backend
* Express.js (Node.js Web Framework)
* Knex.js (SQL Query Builder)
* PostgreSQL
* Advanced Authentication and Authorization
  - bcrypt (only storing hashed passwords)
  - JSON Web Token (sent as cookies with every request, only thing stored client-side)
  - httpOnly & secure (https) cookies
  - CORS (Restricted API access)
  - Front-end simulates sessions and refresh tokens by attempting to login using token stored in cookies
  - Password protected user edits/deletion
* [32 custom errors](https://github.com/JBallin/sweet-api#32-custom-errors)
* [66 integration tests](https://github.com/JBallin/sweet-api#66-integration-tests) (SuperTest/Mocha/Chai)
* Model-View-Controller design pattern
* ESLint (Airbnb style guide)
  - Also used on frontend, which required [custom configuration][3] to work with Create React App

##### External API's
* GitHub

##### Deployment
* Travis CI (automated testing)
* Heroku
  - Pipelines and review/staging apps
  - Auto-deploy post CI success
  - [Production build][4] of React
  - Proper [React Router configuration][5]

## Future Goals
* Social network
  * Friends
  * Likes
  * Granular privacy settings by file (public, friends, private)
  * News feed
  * Notifications
* Discovery/search
  - "What are the most popular VS Code configs?"
* View revision history
* Edit, delete, and add files
